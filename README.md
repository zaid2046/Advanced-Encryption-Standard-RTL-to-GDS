# Advanced-Encryption-Standard-RTL-to-GDS-flow
Encryption has found a place in todayâ€™s digital world, by cultivating a culture of security and privacy. When the AES Encryption algorithm succeeded the Data Encryption Standard as the global 
standard for encryption algorithms in 2001, it fixed many shortcomings of its predecessor. It was seen as the future for encryption in daily life applications. So far, the Advanced Encryption 
Standard has achieved the targets placed during its inception. And it has a long way to grow. AES operates on blocks of data of fixed size, typically 128 bits. The encryption process involves 
a series of mathematical operations, including substitution, permutation, and mixing. These operations are performed on the input data using a key, which generates a ciphertext output.

Here the AES encryption and decryption is implemented in structural level using verilog and simulated waveform is verified. Further the AES netlist is generated and mapped to the sky130hd 
library and the synthesized verilog file is written by yosys. Finally the final layout in standard cells are generated by OpenROAD with the required constraints file and TCL scripts.
